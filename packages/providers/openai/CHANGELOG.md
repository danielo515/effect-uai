# @effect-uai/openai

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- `OpenAISynthesizer` implements the new `SpeechSynthesizerService`
  dialogue methods (`synthesizeDialogue`, `streamSynthesizeDialogue`) —
  both fail with `AiError.Unsupported`. The Layer does NOT ship the
  `MultiSpeakerTts` marker; multi-speaker calls fail at compile time.
- `pronunciations` on `CommonSynthesizeRequest` is silently ignored —
  OpenAI TTS has no phoneme override surface.
- `OpenAITranscribeRequest` narrows out `diarization` — OpenAI's
  transcription endpoint has no diarization, so the gap is
  compile-time on the typed surface. `wordTimestamps` stays on the
  typed request (it works with `whisper-1`); combining it with a
  GPT-4o transcribe model still fails with `AiError.Unsupported`.
  The generic `Transcriber` Layer rejects `diarization: true` at the
  adapter boundary with `Unsupported`.
- Add optional `region` field to every `Config` (`OpenAISynthesizer`,
  `OpenAITranscriber`, `realtimeStt`). Typed union `OpenAiRegion = "default" |
"eu" | (string & {})`; resolves to `eu.api.openai.com` for EU-residency
  projects. `baseUrl` continues to win when set; unknown region strings pass
  through as host prefixes (`{region}.api.openai.com/v1`) for forward compat.
  Each package exports a `resolveHost(cfg)` helper. Non-breaking.

## 0.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 1509883: Two related refactors. Both are breaking but mechanical — a one-line
  rewrite per affected call site.

  ### `Retry` is its own module

  `LanguageModel.retry` and `LanguageModel.Retryable` were not
  LanguageModel-specific — the implementation was a generic `AiError`
  combinator. Hoisted out into `@effect-uai/core/Retry`, with two
  carriers so it covers every model surface:
  - `Retry.stream(schedule)` — for `Stream<A, AiError, R>` (`streamTurn`,
    `streamSynthesis`, `streamTranscriptionFrom`).
  - `Retry.effect(schedule)` — for `Effect<A, AiError, R>` (`turn`,
    `embed`, `embedMany`, `synthesize`, `transcribe`).

  Both gate on the `RateLimited | Unavailable | Timeout` subset; other
  `AiError`s propagate unchanged. The namespace deliberately doesn't
  shadow Effect's own `Stream.retry` / `Effect.retry`.

  ```ts
  // Before
  import { retry } from "@effect-uai/core/LanguageModel"
  streamTurn(req).pipe(retry(schedule))

  // After
  import * as Retry from "@effect-uai/core/Retry"
  streamTurn(req).pipe(Retry.stream(schedule))
  embed(req).pipe(Retry.effect(schedule))
  ```

  `Retryable` and `isRetryable` move to the same module.

  ### `turn` is now on `LanguageModelService`

  `turn(request): Effect<Turn, AiError>` is now a method on the service
  alongside `streamTurn`. Providers without a native non-streaming
  endpoint derive it from `streamTurn` via the new
  `LanguageModel.turnFromStream(streamTurn)` helper; providers with a
  native complete endpoint can override.

  The top-level `LanguageModel.turn(request)` helper is unchanged at
  call sites — it now delegates to the service method instead of
  draining `streamTurn` inline.

  Hand-rolled `LanguageModelService` values (most commonly in tests)
  must now supply a `turn` field. Use `turnFromStream`:

  ```ts
  // Before
  const service: LanguageModelService = {
    streamTurn: () => Stream.fromIterable([...]),
  }

  // After
  import { turnFromStream } from "@effect-uai/core/LanguageModel"
  const streamTurn: LanguageModelService["streamTurn"] = () => Stream.fromIterable([...])
  const service: LanguageModelService = { streamTurn, turn: turnFromStream(streamTurn) }
  ```

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 4d83b13: The bare `effect-uai` name-squat package now ships in lockstep with
  every `@effect-uai/*` scoped package via changesets' `fixed` group —
  no more drift between the placeholder and the real packages. No
  functional changes in this release; the package remains a name
  reservation, install [`@effect-uai/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@effect-uai/core)
  and the provider packages.

## 0.5.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies for `@effect-uai/core@0.5.0` — see core changelog.
  No source changes; speech-only package.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 70c8522: Add STT and TTS

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial release. OpenAI speech provider package, separate from the
  Responses API package (`@effect-uai/responses`).
- `@effect-uai/openai/OpenAISynthesizer` — TTS layer for the generic
  `SpeechSynthesizer` service. Sync `synthesize` only; OpenAI does not
  accept incremental text input.
- `@effect-uai/openai/OpenAITranscriber` — STT layer for the generic
  `Transcriber` service. Supports `gpt-4o-transcribe` (fast, text-only)
  and `whisper-1` (word timestamps via `wordTimestamps: true`).
- `@effect-uai/openai/OpenAIRealtimeTranscriber` — live STT over the
  OpenAI Realtime WebSocket. Registers the `SttStreaming` marker and
  exposes `streamTranscriptionFrom` for mic-to-transcript pipelines
  (24 kHz pcm16 input, partial + final transcript events).
